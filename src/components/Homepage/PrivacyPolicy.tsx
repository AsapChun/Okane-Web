                <b>When We Disclose Information</b> <br/>

                We will not disclose any information we collect in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. <br></br>
                <br/>
                <b>Analytics</b> <br/>

                We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Service. In addition, we work with advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and TikTok that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services. 

                As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service (including our Site, Apps, and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“Interest-based Advertising”).

                As indicated above, vendors and other parties may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. <br/> <br/>

                <b>Your Rights and Choices</b> <br/>
                You may, of course, decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service. Below is further information regarding your rights and choices for the Service: <br/>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Cookies and Pixels.</b> Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies.

                  <li>
                    <b>Do Not Track.</b> Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals.  For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com.
                  </li>

                    <b>App and Imprecise Location Technologies.</b> You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Google Analytics and Advertising.</b>  Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb.

                Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser, device, account, email address, and/or phone number from which you opt out. It will not affect subsequent subscriptions (where applicable). We are not responsible for any other entities’ effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of their statements regarding their opt out options or programs.

                We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of your information. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

                <b>Addtional Disclosures for Neveda Residents:</b>
                <br/>


                Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us at okane-team@okane-app.com.

                <br/>


                These additional disclosures apply only to California residents. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt-out, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise rights.
                <br/>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Notice of Collection: </b> <br/>In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information enumerated in the CCPA: 
                      <br/>
                      Identifiers, including name, email address, mailing address, social security number, and online identifiers (such as IP address). <br/>
                      Customer records, including phone number, billing address, and financial information. <br/>
                      Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law, including gender. <br/>
                      Commercial or transactions information, including records of products, services, and subscriptions purchased, obtained, or considered. <br/>
                      Internet activity, including browsing history, search history, and interactions with a website, email, application, or advertisement. <br/>

                      For further details on information we collect, including the sources from which we receive information, review the “Information We Collect” section above. We collect and use these categories of personal information for the business purposes described in the “How We Use Information” section above, including to manage our Service.
                      <br/>
                      We do not generally sell information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. To the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include the activities set out in this Privacy Policy, such as those disclosed in the “Analytics and Advertising” section above, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity. We disclose the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, characteristics, commercial or transactions information, internet activity, geolocation data, and inferences drawn.
